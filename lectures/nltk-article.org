** Abstract

NLTK, the Natural Language Toolkit, is a suite of *open source* program
*modules, tutorials and problem sets*, providing ready-to-use
computational linguistics courseware. NLTK covers symbolic and
statistical *natural language processing*, and is interfaced to
annotated *corpora*. Students augment and replace existing components,
learn structured programming by example, and manipulate sophisticated
models from the outset.

** Introduction

We need good tools written from scratch by the teachers.

** Choice of Programming Language

+ A shallow learning curve, so that novice programmers get immediate
  rewards for their efforts
+ The language must support rapid prototyping and a short develop/test
  cycle; an obligatory compilation step is a serious detraction
+ The code should be self-documenting, with a transparent syntax and
  semantics
+ It should be easy to write structured programs, ideally
  object-oriented but without the burden associated with languages
  like C++.
+ The language must have an easy-to-use graphics library to support
  the development of graphical user interfaces

** Design Criteria

*** Requirements

+ Easy to use
+ Consistency
+ Extensibility
+ Documentation
+ Simplicity
+ Modularity

*** Non Requirements

+ Comprehensiveness
+ Efficiency
+ Cleverness

** Modules

+ Parsing Modules
+ Tagging Modules
+ Finite State Automata
+ Type Checking
+ Visualization
+ Text Clasification

** Documentation

+ Tutorials
+ Reference Documentation
+ Technical Reports

** Uses of NLTK

+ Assingments (Example: Chunk Parsing)
+ Class demonstrations (Example: Chart Parsing Tool)
+ Advanced Projects (Example: Probabilistic Parsing)

** Evaluation

+ A possitive experience for students and teachers
+ A problem was find corpora.

** Other approaches

+ Linguistic Students
+ Grammar Developers
+ Other Researchers and Developers

** Conclusions and Future Work
The NLTK original idea was its combination of three factors:

1. It was deliberately designed as courseware and gives pedagogical
   goals primary status.

2. Its target audience consists of both linguists and computer
   scientists, and it is accessible and challenging at many levels of
   prior computational skill.

3. Finally, it is based on an object-oriented scripting language
   supporting rapid prototyping and literate programming.
