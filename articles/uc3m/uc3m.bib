abstract = "Text is still the most prevalent Internet media
                  type. Examples of this include popular social
                  networking applications such as Twitter, Craigslist,
                  Facebook, etc. Other web applications such as
                  e-mail, blog, chat rooms, etc. are also mostly text
                  based. A question we address in this paper that
                  deals with text based Internet forensics is the
                  following: given a short text document, can we
                  identify if the author is a man or a woman? This
                  question is motivated by recent events where people
                  faked their gender on the Internet. Note that this
                  is different from the authorship attribution
                  problem. In this paper we investigate author gender
                  identification for short length, multi-genre,
                  content-free text, such as the ones found in many
                  Internet applications. Fundamental questions we ask
                  are: do men and women inherently use different
                  classes of language styles? If this is true, what
                  are good linguistic features that indicate gender?
                  Based on research in human psychology, we propose
                  545 psycho-linguistic and gender-preferential cues
                  along with stylometric features to build the feature
                  space for this identification problem. Note that
                  identifying the correct set of features that
                  indicate gender is an open research problem. Three
                  machine learning algorithms (support vector machine,
                  Bayesian logistic regression and AdaBoost decision
                  tree) are then designed for gender identification
                  based on the proposed features. Extensive
                  experiments on large text corpora (Reuters Corpus
                  Volume 1 newsgroup data and Enron e-mail data)
                  indicate an accuracy up to 85.1% in identifying the
                  gender. Experiments also indicate that function
                  words, word-based features and structural features
                  are significant gender discriminators."

abstract="Women are underrepresented in the IT sector. But the situation in FLOSS (free, libre, open source software) development is really extreme in this respect: past publications and studies show a female participation of around 2 {\%} to 5 {\%} and have shed some light into this problem. In this paper, we give an update the state of knowledge to the current situation of gender in FLOSS, by analyzing the results of surveying more than 2,000 contributors to FLOSS projects in 2013, of which more than 200 were women. Our findings confirm that women enter the FLOSS community later than men, do primarily other tasks than coding, participate less if they have children, and have slightly different reasons to enter (and to stay in) the development communities they join. However, we also find evidence that women are joining FLOSS projects in higher numbers in recent years, and that the share of women devoting few hours per week to FLOSS and full-time dedication is higher than for men. All in all, comparing our results with the ones from the 2000s, the context of participation of women in FLOSS has not changed much.",
