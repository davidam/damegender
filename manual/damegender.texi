@chapter Introduction
@cindex Introduction
@cindex Gender Detection Tools from the Name
@cindex APIs

Damegender is a gender detection tool from the name coded by David
Arroyo MEn@'endez (DAME). See ``@cite{Damegender: Writing and Comparing
Gender Detection Tools}'', @ref{Further reading}.

The gender detection tools from the names are being used usually with
commercial APIs. But many countries has been doing efforts in the last
years contributing names and gender datasets with Open Data
Licenses. So, this software is collecting this effort in an industrial
way and giving new original solutions to classify gender from the name
(we are using Machine Learning algorithms predicting names that is
not appearing in our datasets).

Damegender is giving measures to compare in any moment our solution
with the commercial APIs. So, the user can understand when it's useful
to invest money or not depending of the dataset. Damegender allows to
the users to download a big number of names from a csv file.

This software is written oriented to tests. So, you can check the right
behaivour of the software with python tests for the classes and
methods and with shell tests for the python commands.

Damegender is using Perceval helping to count males and females in a
lot of Internet Communities (wikis, mailing lists, software
repositories, bug tracking systems, ...). ``@cite{Perceval: software
project data at your will}'', @ref{Further reading}. This manual to
show source for count males and females in different contexts (Ex:
@code{git2gender.py, mail2gender.py}).

This software is taking into account the power to predict nations and
ethnicity from the surnames (Ex: @code{surname.py},
@code{surnameincountries.py} and @code{ethnicity.py}).

This book starts explaining the installation. Later, how to install
Damegender. After, it shows Damegender from the commands. Next, it
explains the statistical maths concepts to use Damegender with good
results. The use cases showed allows to imagine a lot of applications
about Damegender. We are giving some data sources about gender
gap. And finally, the theorical frameworks are being showed to put
data into discourses. We are added conclusions as summary and further
reading for extend the interest.

@section Reproducible Research
@cindex Reproducible Research

Damegender has been written thinking on make easy the reproducible
research. It's possible using:
@itemize @bullet
@item
Free Software for Damegender and the Damegender dependencies.
@item
Free documentation for Damegender (this manual, faqs, and a website)
@item
Open Data with sources written.
@item
Good practiques about programming (POO, using standards, unity tests
and user tests)
@end itemize

The are some interesting goal towards reproducible research. That's
more link between code and data in a way where you can download all
data and execute all code. These tasks has not been reached due to:
@itemize @bullet
@item
To retrieve data from Internet becomes slow and you can suffer cuts
in the Internet connection.
@item 
To train machine learning models and sometimes execute machine
learning models with a good number of names is slow. Then it's not
practical for build a pdf make all work of code and data linked.
@end itemize

So in the spectrum of reproducibility (Peng, 2011) the damegender
papers and damegender manual will be in the point of partially linked
and executable code and data.


@node Installation
@chapter Installation
@cindex Installation
@cindex Python Virtual Environment
@cindex Configuring Api Keys

Possible Debian/Ubuntu dependencies:
@example
$ sudo apt-get install python3-nose-exclude python3-dev dict
dict-freedict-eng-spa dict-freedict-spa-eng dictd
@end example

Now, to install damegender with python package:
@example
$ python3 -m venv /tmp/d
$ cd /tmp/d
$ source bin/activate
$ pip install --upgrade pip
$ pip3 install damegender
$ cd lib/python3.5/site-packages/damegender

@end example

To install apis extra dependencies:
@example
$ pip3 install damegender[apis]
@end example

To install mailing lists and repositories extra dependencies:
@example
$ pip3 install damegender[mails_and_repositories]
@end example

To install all possible dependencies

@example

@end example

Currently you can need an api key from:

@itemize @bullet
@item
https://store.genderize.io/documentation

@item
https://gender-api.com

@item
https://www.nameapi.org/

@item

@end example

@node Commands
@chapter Commands
@cindex Commands
@cindex Executing tests
@cindex Regenerating files in post installation
@cindex Perceval
@cindex Commands about Statistics

You must start to check tests to understand that all is ok:

@example
$ cd src/damegender
$ ./testsbycommands.sh            # It must run for you
$ ./testsbycommandsextralocal.sh  # You will need all dependencies
                                  # with: $ pip3 install damegender[all]
$ ./testsbycommandsperceval.sh    # Only about perceval
$ ./testsbycommandsextraapis.sh   # You will need all dependencies
$ ./testmergeinterfiles.sh        # Only about merge datasetes
$ ./testsorig2.sh                 # Checking orig2.py in several countries
@end example

You can continue checking python tests:

Execute all tests:
@example
$ nosetests3 tests
@end example

Another way to execute all tests:
@example
$ ./run-unit-test.sh
@end example

Execute one file:
@example
$ nosetests3 tests/test_basics.py
@end example

Execute one test:
@example
$ nosetests3 tests/test_basics.py:TestBasics.test_indexing
@end example

If you are in a fresh installation, perhaps you want to regenerate by
your own risk some files generated by me, such as, ML models to
understand how it has been generated:

@example
$ python3 postinstall.py
@end example

Another task related is merging datasets with names and frequency, for
instance, you can merge 10 females of Denmark with 10 females of
Deutsch with:

@example
python3 mergeinterfiles.py
--file1="files/names/names_inter/dkfemales10.csv"
--file2="files/names/names_inter/defemales10.csv"
--output=files/tests/testdkde-$(date "+%Y-%m-%d-%H").csv
@end example

You can download and regenerate all csv files by your own risk with:

@example
$ ./testsorig2.sh                   # Checking orig2.py in several countries
$ ./regenerate-inter-files.sh       # Regenerate inter names files
$ ./regenerate-intersurnames.sh     # Regenerate inter surnames files
$ ./regenerate-malefemale-files.sh  # Regenerate male and female files
@end example

We have results applying ML to our dataset cached in json files. You
can regenerate these json files with:

@example
$ ./regenerate-ml-json.sh
@end example

You can find an big list of commands to execute this shell
scripts. Now a detailed execution of some selected examples:

The first command to learn is @code{main.py}. You can play now with this
command:

@example
# Detect gender from a name (INE is the dataset used by default)
$ python3 main.py David
David gender is male
363559  males for David from INE.es
0 females for David from INE.es

# Detect gender from a name only using machine learning
$ python3 main.py Agua --ml=nltk
Agua gender is female
0 males for Agua from INE.es
0 females for Agua from INE.es

# Detect gender from a name (all census and machine learning)
$ python3 main.py David --verbose
365196 males for David from INE.es
0 females for David from INE.es
1193 males for David from Uruguay census
5 females for David from Uruguay census
26645 males for David from United Kingdom census
0 females for David from United Kingdom census
3552580 males for David from United States of America census
12826 females for David from United States of America census
David gender predicted with nltk is male
David gender predicted with sgd is male
David gender predicted with svc is male
David gender predicted with gaussianNB is male
David gender predicted with multinomialNB is male
David gender predicted with bernoulliNB is male
David gender predicted with forest is male
David gender predicted with tree is male
David gender predicted with mlp is male
@end example

The first Free Software for gender detection tool was created in C
language program and you can look for a python version with the name
genderguesser. Some people was working in a Free dataset called
name_dict.txt with 48500 names. I want to give thanks to this effort
with @code{nameincountries.py} due to the good work organizing many
names in different countries.

@example
$ python3 nameincountries.py David
grep -i " David " files/names/nam_dict.txt > files/grep.tmp
males: ['Albania', 'Armenia', 'Austria', 'Azerbaijan', 'Belgium',
'Bosnia and Herzegovina', 'Czech Republic', 'Denmark', 'East Frisia',
'France', 'Georgia', 'Germany', 'Great Britain', 'Iceland', 'Ireland',
'Israel', 'Italy', 'Kazakhstan/Uzbekistan', 'Luxembourg', 'Malta',
'Norway', 'Portugal', 'Romania', 'Slovenia', 'Spain', 'Sweden',
'Swiss', 'The Netherlands', 'USA', 'Ukraine']
females: []
both: []
@end example

To count gender from a git repository:

@example
$ python3 git2gender.py
https://github.com/chaoss/grimoirelab-perceval.git
--directory="/tmp/clonedir"
The number of males sending commits is 15
The number of females sending commits is 7
@end example

You can see a verbose output using the spanish dataset (--language=es) for
males and females with:

@example
$ python3 git2gender.py https://git.drupalcode.org/project/orgmode.git
--directory=/tmp/orgmode --show=all --verbose --language=es
You are not using ml the process is not very slow, but perhaps
you are not finding good results
The number of males sending commits is 2
The list of males sending commits is:
['David Arroyo Menendez', 'David Arroyo']
David Arroyo Menéndez <davidam@@es.gnu.org> (67 commits)
David Arroyo Menendez <davidam9@@riseup.net> (49 commits)
David Arroyo Menéndez <davidam@@gmail.com> (20 commits)
David Arroyo Menendez <david.arroyo@@edoctores.com> (10 commits)
David Arroyo Menendez <davidam@@es.gnu.org> (14 commits)
David Arroyo7 <davidam@@es.gnu.org> (13 commits)
David Arroyo7 <davidam@@gnu.org> (10 commits)
The number of females sending commits is 1
The list of females sending commits is:
['Miriam]
Miriam <miriam@@xxxxxx.es> (23 commits)
The number of people with unknown gender sending commits is 0
The list of people with unknown gender sending commits is:
[]
@end example

To count gender from a mailing list:

@example
$ cd files/mbox
$ wget -c
http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/httpd-announce/201706.mbox
$ cd ../.. 
$ python3 mail2gender.py
http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/httpd-announce/
You are not using ml the process is not very slow, but perhaps you are
not finding good results

The number of males sending mails is 24
The number of females sending mails is 2
The number of people with unknown gender sending mails is 5
@end example

You can execute a verbose output with:

@example
$ python3 mail2gender.py
http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/httpd-announce/
--verbose --show=all
You are not using ml the process is not very slow, but perhaps you are not
finding good results
The number of males sending mails is 24
The list of males sending mails is:
['Jim <jim@@xxxxxx.es>', 'Jacob <jchampion@@xxxxx.org>',
'DENNIS <balaranpillai@@xxxxx.com>', '"Leonard (Jira)" <jira@@xxxxx.org>',
'"Roy" <jira@@xxxxx.org>', '"Roman (Jira)" <jira@@xxxxx.org>',
'"Bertrand" <jira@@xxxxx.org>', '"Mark (Jira)" <jira@@xxxxx.org>',
'"Justin (Jira)" <jira@@xxxxx.org>', '"Simon (Jira)" <jira@@xxxxx.org>',

'"Shane (Jira)" <jira@@xxxxx.org>', '"Kevin A. (Jira)" <jira@@xxxxx.org>',
'"Gordon (Jira)" <jira@@xxxxx.org>', 'Gary <garydgregory@@xxxxx.com>',
'"Owen" <owen.omalley@@xxxxx.com>', '"Sheng (Jira)" <jira@@xxxxx.org>']
The number of females sending mails is 2
The list of females sending mails is:
['Riya <hellen.serviceweb@@xxxxxx.com>',
'"Hannah (Jira)" <jira@@xxxxx.org>']
The number of people with unknown gender sending mails is 5
The list of people with unknown gender sending mails is 
['"SimpaticoTech" <web.info@@xxxxxx.it>',
'Simpatico <web.info@@xxxxxxxxx.it>',
'gmcdonald@@xxxxx.org',
'Hen <bayard@@xxxxx.org>',
'"Jean (Jira)" <jira@@xxxxx.org>']
@end example

With Damegender is possible to guess the authors in an article about a
newspaper with:

@example
$ python3 newspaper2gender.py https://elpais.com/espana/catalunya/2021-11-23/el-presupuesto-de-cataluna-rompe-la-unidad-del-bloque-independentista.html --total=es
@end example

Perhaps you don't know a name, but you have obtained an free key for
an api to retrieve it:

@example
$ python3 api2gender.py Leticia --surname="Martin" --api=namsor
female
scale: 0.99
@end example

If you want to know the gender of a good number of names you can
download results from an api and save in a file with
@code{downloadjson.py}.

@example
$ python3 downloadjson.py --csv=files/names/min.csv --api=genderize
$ cat files/names/genderizefiles_names_min.csv.json
@end example

Now we are going to learn some commands for measure the successful of
our solution:

@example
$ python3 accuracy.py --csv=files/names/min.csv
################### NLTK!!
Gender list: [1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 0, 0]
Guess list:  [1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0]
Dame Gender accuracy: 0.875
@end example

@example
$ python3 confusion.py --csv="files/names/partial.csv" --api=nameapi
--jsondownloaded="files/names/nameapifiles_names_partial.csv.json"
A confusion matrix C is such that Ci,j is equal to the number of
observations known to be in group i but predicted to be in group j.
If the classifier is nice, the diagonal is high because there are true
positives Nameapi confusion matrix:

[[ 3, 0, 0]
 [ 0, 15, 1]]
@end example

@example
$ python3 errors.py --csv="files/names/all.csv" --api="genderguesser"
Gender Guesser with files/names/all.csv has:
+ The error code: 0.22564457518601835
+ The error code without na: 0.026539047204698716
+ The na coded: 0.20453365634192766
+ The error gender bias: 0.0026103980857080703
@end example

You can generate a lot of logs about errors, accuracies and/or confusion:

@example
$ ./logs-accuracies.sh
$ ./logs-confusion.sh
$ ./logs-errors.sh
$ ./logs-count.sh
@end example

Perhaps you are interested on reproduce experiments to determine features:

@example
$ python3 infofeatures.py
# To determine number of components
$ python3 pca-components.py --csv="files/features_list.csv"
# To understand the weight between variables for a target
$ python3 pca-features.py          
@end example

Now we can go to play with surnames:

@example
$ python3 surname.py Gil --total=es
There are 140004 people using Gil in Spain

$ python3 surname.py Lenon --total=us
There are 837 people using Lenon in United States of America

$ python3 ethnicity.py Smith
In United States of America the percentages about the race
of Smith surname is:
White: 73.35
Black: 22.22
Hispanic: 1.56
Asian Pacific Indian American: 0.40
American Indian and Alaska Native: 0.85
Various races: 1.63
@end example

You can download sources chosen by damegender and generate the damegender
csv files from any country with:

@example
$ python3 orig2.py es --download
@end example

To generate json files, such as, a rest service is downloaded you can use
the next python command

@example
$ python3 csv2jsonapirest.py files/names/names_inter/dkfemales10.csv --outdir="files/tmp" --gender=female --names_by_multiple_files=1 
@end example

In the last chapter, we were learning to execute some commands such as
@code{accuracy.py}, @code{confusion.py}, or @code{errors.py}, but
perhaps you need to understand more theory about statistics to
understand why this commands is being interesting for you.

@section Measuring success and error
@cindex Measuring success and error

To guess the sex, we have an true idea (ex: female) and we obtain
a result with a method (ex: using an api, querying a dataset or
with a machine learning model). The guessed result could be male,
female or perhaps unknown. To remember some definitions about results
about this matter:

@strong{True positive} is to find a value guessed as true if the value
in the data source is positive.

@strong{True negative} is to find a value guessed as true if the the
value in the data source is negative.

@strong{False positive} is to find a value guessed as false if the the
value in the data source is positive.

@strong{False negative} is to find a value guessed as false if the the
value in the data source is negative.

So, we can find a vocabulary for measure true, false, success and
errors. We can make a summary in the gender name context about
mathematical concepts:

@strong{Precision} is about true positives divided by true positives plus false
positives

@example
(femalefemale + malemale ) /
(femalefemale + malemale + femalemale)
@end example

@strong{Recall} is about true positives divided by true positives plus false negatives.

@example
(femalefemale + malemale ) /
(femalefemale + malemale + malefemale +
+ femaleundefined + maleundefined)
@end example

@strong{Accuracy} is about true positives divided by all.

@example
(femalefemale + malemale ) /
(femalefemale + malemale + malefemale +
+ femalemale + femaleundefined + maleundefined)
@end example

The @strong{F1 score} is the harmonic mean of precision and recall
taking both metrics into account in the following equation:

@example
2 * (
(precision * recall) /
(precision + recall))
@end example

In Damengender, we are using @code{accuracy.py} to apply these concepts. Take
a look tothe practice:

@example
$ python3 accuracy.py --api="damegender" --measure="f1score"
--csv="files/names/partialnoundefined.csv"

@strong{Error coded} is about the true is different than the guessed:

@example
(femalemale + malefemale + maleundefined + femaleundefined) /
(malemale + femalemale + malefemale +
+ femalefemale + maleundefined + femaleundefined)
@end example

@strong{Error coded without na} is about the true is different than
the guessed, but without undefined results.

@example
(maleundefined + femaleundefined) /
(malemale + femalemale + malefemale +
+ femalefemale + maleundefined + femaleundefined)
@end example

@strong{Error gender bias} is to understand if the error is bigger guessing males than females or viceversa.

@strong{Weighted error} is about the true is different than the guessed, but giving a weight to the guessed as undefined.

@example
(femalemale + malefemale +
+ w * (maleundefined + femaleundefined)) /
(malemale + femalemale + malefemale + femalefemale +
+ w * (maleundefined + femaleundefined))
@end example

In Damegender, we have coded @code{errors.py} to implement several
definitions in different apis.

The confusion matrix creates a matrix about the true and the guess. If you have this confusion matrix:

@example
[[ 2, 0, 0]
 [ 0, 5, 0]]
@end example

It means, I have 2 females true and I’ve guessed 2 females and I’ve 5 males true and I’ve guessed 5 males. I don’t have errors in my classifier.

@example
[[ 2  1  0]
[ 2 14  0]]
@end example

It means, I have 2 females true and I’ve guessed 2 females and I’ve 14 males true and I’ve guessed 14 males. 1 female was considered male, 2 males was considered female.

In Damegender, we have coded @code{confusion.py} to implement this
concept:

@example
python3 confusion.py --csv=files/names/min.csv
--api=damegender --jsondownloaded=files/names/min.csv.json 
A confusion matrix C is such that Ci,j is equal to the number of
observations known to be in group i but predicted to be in group j.
If the classifier is nice, the diagonal is high because there are
true positives
Damegender confusion matrix:

      M   F   U  
M  [[ 5,  0,  0 ]
F   [ 0,  1,  0 ]]
@end example

Remember that we can retrieve the json file from several apis having
the names to be guessed in the csv file with @code{downloadjson.py}:

@example
$ python3 downloadjson.py --csv="files/names/min.csv" --api="genderapi" 
@end example

Similar to confusion is ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) is a
graphical plot that illustrates the diagnostic ability of a binary
classifier system as its discrimination threshold is varied. The ROC
curve is created by plotting the true positive rate (TPR) against the
false positive rate (FPR) at various threshold settings.

In Damegender, you can use ROC relative to machine learning algorithms
with the next command:

@example
$ python3 roc.py svc
@end example

@image{images/roc_svc,6in,,ROC about SVC}

The countries where the main language is spanish (Uruguay + Spain) and
english (USA + United Kingdom + Australia) are having very similar
variation with the features chosen between males and females with
these datasets (to remember is the datasets extracted from official
statistics provided by the states). Canada, a country french centric
has different rules with this features.

The letter a is varying 0.2 from males to females in (USA and Uruguay)
and 0.1 from males to females (United Kingdom, Australia and
Spain). The last letter a is varying 0.5 from males to females in
(Australia, Spain) around 0.4 in (USA, United Kingdom) and 0.2 in
Uruguay. The last letter o from females to males is varying 0.2 in
(Spain, Australia) and is equal in (Uruguay, USA, United Kingdom). For
the last letter consonant all countries is giving the result that is
for males, with results from 0.2 to 0.5: Uruguay and USA (0.5), United
Kingdom (0.4), Australia and Spain (0.3). So last letter vocal is
reverse tha last letter consonant. First letter consonant or first
letter vocal is a non significative feature due to so similar results
in english and spanish.

Surely, the rules it’s a coincidence but we think that is a
coincidence between languages due to that there are a good number of
names to think different.

@subsection Choosing components
@cindex Choosing components

After, to choose features for our machine learning task, we can
understand if this features makes sense with Principal Component
Analysis. We have written 2 scripts for this task
@code{pca-components.py} and @code{pca-features.py}. With
@code{pca-components.py} we are giving a csv (files/features_list.csv,
files/features_list_no_cat.csv, ...) and the output is an image where
we can visualize a curve to determine when this curve stops the growth
the number of components.

@image{images/pca_components_files_features_list_no_cat.csv,6in,,PCA Curve about the number of components}

In the image, we can see that the curve stops the growth in the fourth
component.

When you know the components you can execute @code{pca-features.py} so:

@example
$ python3 pca-features.py  --categorical=both --components=4
The json file is created in files/pca.json
The html file is created in files/pca.html
@end example

@image{images/pca-analysis,6in,,Analyze components to determine gender in names}

To simplify and to learn, we can observe this analysis without
letters. In this analysis, we can observe 4 components.

The first component is about if the last letter is vocal or
consonant. If the last letter is vocal we can find a female and if the
last letter is a consonant we can find a male.

The second component is about the first letter. The last letter is
determining females and the first letter is determining males.

The third component is not giving relevant information.

The fourth component is giving the last_letter_a and the
first_letter_vocal is for females.

@section Introduction

There are many research studies count males and females in specific
communities such as Twitter, StackOverflow, ... A specific community
has some clues to determine male or female, for example, in Twitter
you can observe the photo, nickname, real name, ...

In this chapter we are going to apply the concepts to determine gender
in real situations observing where the gender is provided.

@section Counting males and females in Debian
@cindex Counting males and females in Debian

In the Debian community all members must have a gpg key to collaborate,
so we can count males and females from the keyring. With gpg commands
you can import a the debian keyring and dump the debian keyring in a
csv file.

@example
$ rsync -az --progress keyring.debian.org::keyrings/keyrings/ .
@end example

We have generated a script to count males and females:

@example
~/git/damegender/src/damegender$ python3 count-debian-gender.py
Perhaps you need wait some minutes. You can take a tea or coffe now
debian males: 795
debian females: 24
@end example

In the dump of the debian keyring dataset we have divided name,
surname and email in different fields. So, it's easy detect the name,
although some names has several emails.

We have choosen the United States of America dataset and we are using
the method name_frec to decide for male or female in the row. Take a
look to the source:

@example
import csv
import unicodedata
import unidecode
from pprint import pprint
import re
from app.dame_gender import Gender
from app.dame_utils import DameUtils

du = DameUtils()
g = Gender()

result=""
dm = []

with open('files/debian-maintainers-gpg-2020-04-01.csv') as csvfile:
    reader = csv.reader(csvfile, delimiter=',', quotechar='|')
    aux = ""
    cnt = 0
    for row in reader:
        cnt = cnt +1
        if (aux != row[0]):
            dm.append(row[0])
        aux = row[0]

print("Perhaps you need wait some minutes. You can take a tea or coffe now")

females = 0
males = 0
for rowdm in dm:
    if (int(g.name_frec(str(rowdm.upper()), 'us')['females'])
    > int(g.name_frec(str(rowdm.upper()), 'us')['males'] )):
        females = females + 1
    else:
        males = males + 1

print("debian males: %s" % males)
print("debian females: %s" % females)

csvfile.close()
@end example

The advantage using the method @code{name_frec} is about to understand
how you are deciding male or female in the script counting males and
females. In this script the decision is simple: a name is male if
there are more males than females and female if there are more females
than males.

The United States of America dataset is a good choice for Free
Software communities, due to that this communities is based on english
as main language and United States of America is a leader country in
software development. United States of America hosts people from
different countries due to migrations towards good companies and
universities.

In general, you can choose @code{csv2gender.py} to count males,
females and unknows in a csv file. For example, doing this:

@example
$ python3 csv2gender.py --first_name_position=0
files/debian-maintainers-gpg-2020-04-01.csv --verbose
@end example

But, a research must understand the source, too.

In the next diagram we can see (78.4% of males, 5.4% of females and
16.2% of unknowns).

@image{images/debiangnulinux,6in,,Debian by gender}

We can retrieve the names of unknows and to decide about the name in
the sense of retrieve the gender from a commercial api (genderapi,
genderize, namsor, nameapi, ...) or to classify the name as a software
company or a bug. For now, the Open datasets contributed by states
about names are very good but not all countries has the idea of
contribute the names.  Remember that you can download names from a csv
file with @code{downloadjson.py}:

@example
$ python3 downloadjson.py --api=genderize --csv=files/names/min.csv
@end example

@section Counting males and females in Linux Kernel
@cindex Counting males and females in Linux Kernel

When I'm writing this book the Linux Kernels maintainers appears in

I have downloaded the file and applied a single command:

@example
 cat maintainers.html | w3m -dump -T text/html
 | grep "Mail:" > maintainers.txt
@end example

You can makes fixes to this command from GNU/Emacs or with shell
scripting. Later, you can apply:

@example
$ python3 count-kernel.py
@end example

@section Counting males and females in Forbes
@cindex Counting males and females in Forbes

In the second example, we are using guess without machine learning
instead of name_frec. If you are using guess you are trusting on
damegender to take the decision, but perhaps you are not agree.

Please take a look about our guess method in the current state:

@example
    def guess(self, name, binary=False, *args, **kwargs):
        # guess list method
        dataset = kwargs.get('dataset', 'es')
        # guess method to check names dictionary
        guess = ''
        name = unidecode.unidecode(name).title()
        name.replace(name, "")
        dicc = self.name_frec(name, dataset)
        m = int(dicc['males'])
        f = int(dicc['females'])
        if ((m == 0) and (f == 0)):
            if binary:
                guess = 2
            else:
                guess = "unknown"
        elif (m > f):
            if binary:
                guess = 1
            else:
                guess = "male"
        elif (f > m):
            if binary:
                guess = 0
            else:
                guess = "female"
        else:
            if binary:
                guess = 2
            else:
                guess = "unknown"
        return guess
@end example

We are using the spanish dataset by default and the rest is the same
idea that in the last script: more people using the name.

@section Deciding for males and females in images
@cindex Deciding for males and females in images

There are many free software tools for decide gender in images
files. We can use these tools to decide gender about images from

$ cd damefaces/bin
$ python3 damefaces.py girl1.jpg
@end example


@section Webscraping and Damegender (counting scholars)
@cindex Webscraping and Damegender (counting scholars)

Sometimes, we can reach the database of names from a website, for
example, we can retrieve a list of academics from Spain thanks to
webometrics and the next script:

@example
from lxml import html
import requests

print("Introduce an url from webometrics, for example,
       https://www.webometrics.info/en/GoogleScholar/Spain")

import argparse

parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
parser.add_argument("url", help="display the gender")
args = parser.parse_args()

page = requests.get(args.url)
tree = html.fromstring(page.content)

academics = tree.xpath('//tr/td/a/strong/text()')

print('Academics: %s' % academics)
@end example

If you have retrieved the list of names in a file
@code{files/scientifics.txt}, you could count males and females with
the next script called @code{count-scientifics.py}:

@example
import csv
import unicodedata
import unidecode
import re

from pprint import pprint
from app.dame_gender import Gender
from app.dame_utils import DameUtils
from ast import literal_eval
from app.dame_sexmachine import DameSexmachine

du = DameUtils()
g = Gender()
s = DameSexmachine()

with open('files/scientifics.txt') as f:
    mainlist = [list(literal_eval(line)) for line in f]

l = mainlist[0]

ll = []
for i in l:
    ll.append(i.split())


ten = ll[0:10]
hundred = ll[0:100]
thousand = ll[0:1000]

x = 0
y = 0
males = 0
females = 0
for j in hundred:
    if (len(j[0]) == 1):
        x = x + 1
    else:
        sex = g.guess(j[0], binary=False)
        y = y +1
        if (sex == "male"):
            males = males + 1
        elif (sex == "female"):
            females = females + 1

print("Number of scientifics with a single letter as first name: %s" % x)
print("Number of scientifics with the first name normal: %s" % y)
print("Number of females scientifics: %s" % females)
print("Number of males scientifics: %s" % males)

for j in thousand:
    if (len(j[0]) == 1):
        x = x + 1
    else:
        sex = g.guess(j[0], binary=False)
        y = y +1
        if (sex == "male"):
            males = males + 1
        else:
            females = females + 1

print("Number of females scientifics: %s" % females)
print("Number of males scientifics: %s" % males)
@end example

And the results are:

@example
Number of females scientifics: 31425
Number of males scientifics: 47945
@end example

@image{images/scientifics_by_gender,6in,,Academics by gender}

So, the percentage of academic people classified as females in Spain
is bigger than Free Software people classified as females. Having a
gender gap in both situations.

R retrieves the data from genderize and arxiv. The gap is especially
large in authorship positions associated with seniority, and
prestigious journals have fewer women authors. Additionally, they
estimates that men are invited by journals to submit papers at
approximately double the rate of women. Wealthy countries, notably
Japan, Germany, and Switzerland, had fewer women authors than poorer
ones. It concludes that the STEMM gender gap will not close without

@section Gender Inequality in the World
@cindex Gender Inequality in the World

Gender gap or gender inequality is the idea that men and women are not
equal and that gender affects an individual's living experience. These
differences arise from distinctions in biology, psychology, and
cultural norms. Some of these types of distinctions are empirically
grounded while others appear to be socially constructed. Studies show
the different lived experience of genders across many domains
including education, life expectancy, personality, interests, family
life, careers, and political affiliations. Gender inequality is
experienced differently across different cultures. (Source: wikipedia,
2020)

The women is underrepresent in the labour world (among adults aged
from 25 to 54 has stagmated over the past 20 years, standing at 31
percentage points. The gender pay gap exists, too, so the women are
paid 16% less than men. Share of women and men with an account at a
financial institution is 65% of the total in women and 72% of the
total in men. 31% of young women aged 15 to 24 are not in education,
employment or training in 2020, more than double rate for young men
(14%). Violence against women is 18% of ever-partnered women aged 15
to 49 experienced sexual and/or physical violence by an intimate
partner in the previous 12 months.@footnote{https://www.unwomen.org}

In the graphic we can understand gender gap in stem in 2009 and
compare with gender gap in the market:

@image{images/gender-gap-stem,6in,,Gender Gap by Continents}

So the gender gap in STEM is bigger than the labour market in general. 

@section Gender Inequality in Free Software
@cindex Gender Inequality in Free Software

The gender gap in the Free Software world is so high we are presenting
preliminar due to that we can reduce the percentage of unknowns to
male or female. But we can observe that the gender gap is bigger in
the Free Software world than in STEM.

The context of the operatings systems is not feminist by different
reasons. In the Free Software world there are many males developing
the software. But in another Operating Systems there are another
problems about the male domination, for example, Microsoft will create
the most rich men in the world for many
years@footnote{https://www.forbes.com/profile/bill-gates/?sh=79472717689f}. Apple
was classificated as the most valuable company in the
world@footnote{https://forbes.es/listas/32245/apple-la-marca-mas-valiosa-del-2017/}. By
intersectionality, to create companies more powerful than states is bad
for the democracy and in a world where exists the gender gap the
change to the gender equity is a pressure of values.

A Linux operating system such as we find in a CD of Ubuntu, RedHat or
Suse is composed by the Kernel (Linux) and GNU programs. Later, it's
organized in a distribution, such as Ubuntu and Debian. We have
choosen Debian as use case and we are counting males females in Linux,
too.

@image{images/debiangnulinux,6in,,Debian GNU/Linux by Gender}

In Debian, the number of males is 461 (86.8%), the number of females
is 42 (7.9%) and the number of names undefined is 28.

In GNU, the number of males is 215 (94.7%) and the number of females
is 12 (5.3%).

In the Kernel, the number of males is 1387 (72.5%) and the number of
females is 62 (3.2%). There are a big number of undefined, so we must
debug these data, but we have not time in this version of the manual.

@itemize @bullet
@item
To generate objectives about the research study

@item
To read and to understand previous works.

@item
To choose some theorical framework.

A theoretical framework consists of concepts and, together with their
definitions and reference to relevant scholarly literature, existing
theory that is used for your particular study.
In the last chapters you have learnt to count males and females, but
you need give meaning to the words that you are using about your
gender study. That is the point in this chapter.

We present some theorical frameworks that you can use as example in
your works:

@section Philosophies about software, market, freedom and gender
@cindex Software Philosophies
@cindex Free Software
@cindex Open Source
@cindex Richard Stallman

There are different philosophies developing software and we are
counting males and females in Internet, so the floor is the software
in this world. If we must analyze gender in a country the ideology is
changing in the place where you are. In the software world is the same
problem. So, we are giving the vocabulary and the philosophy for speak
about software and ideologies.

The propietary software is the most common idea for the common people,
operating systems such as Microsoft Windows or Mac OS. If you are
using software with propietary licenses, the source files will be
containing copyright notes such as:

@example
# Copyright (C) 2020  David Arroyo Menéndez

# Author: David Arroyo Menéndez <davidam@@gmail.com>
# Maintainer: David Arroyo Menéndez <davidam@@gmail.com>

# All rights reserved
@end example

This idea is associated to big companies leading the market but any
people can use this philosophy. The criticism appears with Richard
Stallman about privacy and lack of freedom to the academic people, or
hackers (people who knows read and write software and they do it for
his objectives or global objectives). I could to say the monopoly is
too strong with this license and the current social inertia and now
nobody can change the market, we need another licenses to preserve the
free market with an ethical strategy for startups and students. 

Richard Stallman defines the Free Software with four freedoms: (0) to
run the program, (1) to study and change the program in source code
form, (2) to redistribute exact copies, and (3) to distribute modified
versions. See ``@cite{Free Software Free Society}'', @ref{Further reading}

This idea to build software as a social good and motivated by ethical
values. The solution is to apply the GPL license and to request to GNU
to include the software.

The copyright note in GNU would be similar to:

@example
;; This software is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
;; it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
;; the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
;; (at your option) any later version.

;; This software is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
;; but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
;; MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
;; GNU General Public License for more details.

;; You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
;; along with GNU Emacs.  If not, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.
@end example

On opposition the Open Source movement believes in free licenses, but
they thinks that the software is business and they want to develop
Free Software by economy, so they prefer change the word Free Software
by Open Source claiming their philosophy.

They redefines the Free Software Definition by the Open Source
Definition@footnote{https://opensource.org/osd}.

@example
1. Free Redistribution

The license shall not restrict any party from selling or giving away
the software as a component of an aggregate software distribution
containing programs from several different sources. The license shall
not require a royalty or other fee for such sale.

2. Source Code

The program must include source code, and must allow distribution in
source code as well as compiled form. Where some form of a product is
not distributed with source code, there must be a well-publicized
means of obtaining the source code for no more than a reasonable
reproduction cost, preferably downloading via the Internet without
charge. The source code must be the preferred form in which a
programmer would modify the program. Deliberately obfuscated source
code is not allowed. Intermediate forms such as the output of a
preprocessor or translator are not allowed.

3. Derived Works

The license must allow modifications and derived works, and must allow
them to be distributed under the same terms as the license of the
original software.

4. Integrity of The Author's Source Code

The license may restrict source-code from being distributed in
modified form only if the license allows the distribution of "patch
files" with the source code for the purpose of modifying the program
at build time. The license must explicitly permit distribution of
software built from modified source code. The license may require
derived works to carry a different name or version number from the
original software.

5. No Discrimination Against Persons or Groups

The license must not discriminate against any person or group of
persons.

6. No Discrimination Against Fields of Endeavor

The license must not restrict anyone from making use of the program in
a specific field of endeavor. For example, it may not restrict the
program from being used in a business, or from being used for genetic
research.

7. Distribution of License

The rights attached to the program must apply to all to whom the
program is redistributed without the need for execution of an
additional license by those parties.

8. License Must Not Be Specific to a Product

The rights attached to the program must not depend on the program's
being part of a particular software distribution. If the program is
extracted from that distribution and used or distributed within the
terms of the program's license, all parties to whom the program is
redistributed should have the same rights as those that are granted in
conjunction with the original software distribution.

9. License Must Not Restrict Other Software

The license must not place restrictions on other software that is
distributed along with the licensed software. For example, the license
must not insist that all other programs distributed on the same medium
must be open-source software.

10. License Must Be Technology-Neutral

No provision of the license may be predicated on any individual
technology or style of interface.
@end example

In the point six, we find the conflict with the feminist theories due to
the possitive discrimination is a good idea to reach gender equity.

The GNU philosophy has the same problem explained on a different
way. Only the Free Software is a good idea, if the software is not Free
Software, then it's Propietary Software (the bad idea to avoid).

In Damegender, we want to deliver Free Software by practical reasons
released with GPLv3 trough pypi.org and github.com the very popular
sites to distribute Free Software written in Python. But we understand
that we can to make positive discrimination in the development in
favor to the women as an experiment with this copyright note in the
development branch:

@example
# You can share, copy and modify this software if you are a woman or you
# are David Arroyo Menéndez and you include this note.
@end example

This book has been developed with this license, too.

@section Multiculturalism, Interculturalism
@cindex Interculturalism
@cindex Multiculturalism

The term multiculturalism has a range of meanings within the contexts
of sociology, of political philosophy, and of colloquial use. In
sociology and in everyday usage, it is a synonym for "ethnic
pluralism", with the two terms often used interchangeably, for
example, a cultural pluralism in which various ethnic groups
collaborate and enter into a dialogue with one another without having
to sacrifice their particular identities. It can describe a mixed
ethnic community area where multiple cultural traditions exist (such
as New York City or Trieste) or a single country within which they do
(such as Switzerland, Belgium or Russia). Groups associated with an
indigenous, aboriginal or autochthonous ethnic group and
settler-descended ethnic groups are often the focus.

In reference to sociology, multiculturalism is the end-state of either
a natural or artificial process (for example: legally-controlled
immigration) and occurs on either a large national scale or on a
smaller scale within a nation's communities. On a smaller scale this
can occur artificially when a jurisdiction is established or expanded
by amalgamating areas with two or more different cultures (e.g. French
Canada and English Canada). On a large scale, it can occur as a result
of either legal or illegal migration to and from different
jurisdictions around the world (for example, Anglo-Saxon settlement of
Britain by Angles, Saxons and Jutes in the 5th century or the
colonization of the Americas by Europeans, Africans and Asians since
the 16th century).

In reference to political science, multiculturalism can be defined as
a state's capacity to effectively and efficiently deal with cultural
plurality within its sovereign borders. Multiculturalism as a
political philosophy involves ideologies and policies which vary
widely. It has been described as a "salad bowl" and as a "cultural
mosaic", in contrast to a "melting pot". (Source: wikipedia, 2020)

Interculturalism refers to support for cross-cultural dialogue and
challenging self-segregation tendencies within cultures. 
Interculturalism involves moving beyond mere passive acceptance of a
multicultural fact of multiple cultures effectively existing in a
society and instead promotes dialogue and interaction between
cultures.

Interculturalism has arisen in response to criticisms of existing
policies of multiculturalism, such as criticisms that such policies
had failed to create inclusion of different cultures within society,
but instead have divided society by legitimizing segregated separate
communities that have isolated themselves and accentuated their
specificity. It is based on the recognition of both differences and
similarities between cultures. It has addressed the risk of the
creation of absolute relativism within postmodernity and in
multiculturalism. (Source: wikipedia, 2020)

Aguado proposes these principles (See ``@cite{La
Educaci@'on Intercultural: Concepto, Paradigmas, Realizaciones}'',
@ref{Further reading}.

1. Promote the respect by all cultures together and condemn the
politics to change the culture of the people towards the culture
dominant. (Borrelli y Essinger, 1989)

2. The intercultural education is relevant for any student, not only
for the foreigners and minorities (Borrelli and Essinger, 1989)

3. The troubles created by the ethnic and cultural diversity of the
society has many solutions, there not an only magic solution. The
politics in education there are partials because we are in a global
society (Galino, 1990).

4. It's based in the perception about to accept cultures in contact,
it's near to the form of life of societies with a poor cultural
context instead of societies with more rich, more structure and high
social control.

5. We need develop a scheme of concepts with many cultures
demonstrating in the education that the knowledge is the common
property of all people (Walking, 1990).

So, interculturalism and multiculturalism are the same concept in many
uses, both recognize the cultural diversity in the contexts where
there are the diversity, but interculturalism is doing an emphasis in
the enrichment of all cultures respecting the diversity.

Damegender understands has an international and intercultural
perspective about guess the gender about the name in the sense that in
many countries are existing many different cultures determining names,
surnames with a gender. So, in Spain are living 4 so important
cultures (no foreigners):

@itemize @bullet
@item
Castillian (culture dominant)

@item
Catalan

@item
Basque

@item
Galician

@end itemize

These cultures has correlations with names and surnames.

@section Feminism, Ecofeminism and Intersectionality
@cindex Feminism
@cindex Ecofeminism
@cindex Intersectionality

Feminism is a range of social movements, political movements, and
ideologies that aim to define and establish the political, economic,
personal, and social equality of the sexes. Feminism incorporates the
position that societies prioritize the male point of view, and that
women are treated unjustly within those societies. Efforts to change
that include fighting against gender stereotypes and establishing
educational, professional, and interpersonal opportunities and
outcomes for women that are equal to those for men. (Source:
wikipedia, 2020).

Ecofeminism is a branch of feminism that sees environmentalism, and
the relationship between women and the earth, as foundational to its
analysis and practice. Ecofeminist thinkers draw on the concept of
gender to analyse the relationships between humans and the natural
world. The term was coined by the French writer Françoise d'Eaubonne
in her book Le F@'eminisme ou la Mort (1974). Ecofeminist theory asserts
a feminist perspective of Green politics that calls for an
egalitarian, collaborative society in which there is no one dominant
group. Today, there are several branches of ecofeminism, with
varying approaches and analyses, including liberal ecofeminism,
spiritual/cultural ecofeminism, and social/socialist ecofeminism (or
materialist ecofeminism). Interpretations of ecofeminism and how it
might be applied to social thought include ecofeminist art, social
justice and political philosophy, religion, contemporary feminism, and
poetry. (Source: wikipedia, 2020)

The goal 5 in United Nations in 2020 is ``Achieve gender equality and
empower all women and girls''. (Source: United Nations website)

Damegender don't reduce the gender gap per se. It's a tool to measure
gender gap in Internet. The data is the basis to do politics to reduce
the gender gap. These data must be used in contexts helping to the
women, such as, feminism asociations, political parties or trade
unions with accomodation in favor to the gender equity, etc.

Damegender is giving more oportunities to the women to reduce the
gender gap than another tools due to the license system.

Intersectionality is a theoretical framework for understanding how
aspects of a person's social and political identities (e.g., gender,
sex, race, class, sexuality, religion, disability, physical
appearance, height, etc.) combine to create unique modes of
discrimination and privilege. Intersectionality identifies advantages
and disadvantages that are felt by people due to a combination of
factors. For example, a black woman might face discrimination from a
business that is not distinctly due to her race (because the business
does not discriminate against black men) nor distinctly due to her
gender (because the business does not discriminate against white
women), but due to a unique combination of the two factors. (Source:
wikipedia, 2020)

So, to understand discrimination, we must understand multiple
factors. For example, the free software communities with the
principles about no discrimination and share code seems a good place
to advance in the rights of the women in the software world, but if
the reality is a place dominated by men then we must look for another
ideas. Intersectionality is about to find the best formula to advance
in values understanding that the rights of the women depends of
another values such as democracy, free speech, labor rights, ...

@section Gender
@cindex Gender

Gender is the range of characteristics pertaining to, and
differentiating between, masculinity and femininity. Depending on the
context, these characteristics may include biological sex, sex-based
social structures (i.e., gender roles), or gender identity.

Most cultures use a gender binary, having two genders (boys/men and
girls/women); those who exist outside these groups fall under the
umbrella term non-binary or genderqueer. Some societies have specific
genders besides "man" and "woman", such as the hijras of South Asia;
these are often referred to as third genders (and fourth genders,
etc.). (Source: wikipedia, 2020)

Transgender people have a gender identity or gender expression that
differs from their sex assigned at birth. Some transgender people who
desire medical assistance to transition from one sex to another
identify as transsexual. Transgender, often shortened as trans, is
also an umbrella term. In addition to including people whose gender
identity is the opposite of their assigned sex (trans men and trans
women), it may include people who are not exclusively masculine or
feminine (people who are non-binary or genderqueer, including
bigender, pangender, genderfluid, or agender). Other definitions of
transgender also include people who belong to a third gender, or else
conceptualize transgender people as a third gender. The term
transgender may be defined very broadly to include
cross-dressers. (Source: wikipedia, 2020)

In Damegender, we are applying binary ideology classifying people as
male or female only due to that the free datasets provided by the
states only supports this idea in the moment writing this book. But we
respect the non binary philosophies due to this philosophies are
describing a reality.

There are many options to count males and females in Internet, a good
idea is to retrieve a dataset about males and females. Damegender is
giving the most modern open datasets and it provides a good toolkit for
many solutions: 

@itemize @bullet
@item
To count males and females in git repositories, mailing lists, csv files, ...

@item
To predict gender with machine learning if the name is not in the dataset

@item
To guess the country about the surname

@item
To understand how is used a name with different cultural regions

@item
To retrieve names from commercial apis

@item
To view relationships between names and races

different rates of Internet use. Methods. The paper presents new
survey data collected by the author in 1996, 1998, and 1999 showing
trends in Internet use, and presents regression models of Internet
access and use. Results. Two statistically significant gender gaps
exist on the Internet: in access and in use. The access gap is not the
product of gender-specific factors, but is explained by socioeconomic
and other differences between men and women. The use gap is the result
of both socioeconomics and some combination of underlying
gender-specific phenomena. Conclusions. Around one-half of the
"digital divide" between men and women on the Internet is
fundamentally gender related. Several possible causes may explain this
phenomenon.
