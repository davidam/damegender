"Things you need to know"
"Important information for interpreting these statistics:"

"• baby name statistics are compiled from first names recorded when live births are registered in England and Wales as part of civil registration, a legal requirement"

"• the statistics are based only on live births which occurred in the calendar year, as there is no public index or register of stillbirths"

"• babies born in England and Wales to women whose usual residence is outside England and Wales are included in the statistics for England and Wales as a whole, but excluded from any sub-division of England and Wales"

"• the statistics are based on the exact spelling of the name given on the birth certificate. Grouping names with similar pronunciation would change the rankings. Exact names are given so users can group if they wish"

"Quality and Methodology"
"The Baby Names Quality and Methodology Information document contains important information on:"
"• the strengths and limitations of the data
• the quality of the output: including the accuracy of the data, how it compares with related data
• uses and users
• how the output was created
"

"Our User guide to birth statistics provides information on data quality, legislation and procedures relating to birth statistics. "

"Notes and definitions"
"Baby name statistics do not include births to women usually resident in England or Wales who give birth abroad. They do include births to women whose usual residence is outside England and Wales where the birth occurred in England or Wales."

"Births where the name of the baby is not stated are excluded from all the ranks. Births where the usual residence of the mother was not in England and Wales are excluded from the regional ranks and from the separate England and Wales ranks."

"Names with a count of 2 or less in total within England and Wales have been redacted using S40 of the Freedom of Information Act in order to protect the confidentiality of individuals. This is consistent with the disclosure control methodology used for births. Further information on the ONS policy for protecting confidentiality within birth statistics can be found on our website: "
