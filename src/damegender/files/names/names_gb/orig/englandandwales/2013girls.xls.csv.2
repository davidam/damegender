"Terms and Conditions"



"National Statistics are produced to high professional standards set out in the Code of Practice for Official Statistics. They are produced free from any political interference."

"The United Kingdom Statistics Authority has designated these statistics as National Statistics, in accordance with the Statistics and Registration Service Act 2007 and signifying compliance with the Code of Practice for Official Statistics. "
"Designation can be broadly interpreted to mean that the statistics: "
"• meet identified user needs; "
"• are well explained and readily accessible; "
"• are produced according to sound methods, and "
"• are managed impartially and objectively in the public interest. "

"Once statistics have been designated as National Statistics it is a statutory requirement that the Code of Practice shall continue to be observed."
